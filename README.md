## Deployment
The back-end of my application is a RESTful API with full Create, Read, Update and Destroy (CRUD) functionalty. The back-end-end also uses the following technologies:

#### Heroku:
Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages. One of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go.
#### Django:
Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source. 
#### Django REST Framework:
Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
#### PostgreSQL:
Focus on application innovation instead of database management. Migrate with ease to a fully managed open-source database with support for the latest PostgreSQL versions. Azure Database for PostgreSQL offers a service-level agreement (SLA) of up to 99.99 percent uptime, AI-powered performance optimization, and advanced security.
